ACCORDING TO AN AUTOCAR INDIA REPORT WHICH CITED LATIN NCAP TEST RESULTS, THE INDIA-MADE BALENO WAS TESTED IN FRONTAL AND SIDE-IMPACT, WHIPLASH AND PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION. IN THE TESTS, THE CAR ACHIEVED 20.03 PER CENT IN ADULT OCCUPANT BOX, 17.06 PER CENT IN CHILD OCCUPANT BOX AND A DISMAL 6.98 PER CENT IN SAFETY ASSISTS. THE CARÂ€™S BEST RESULT WAS IN THE PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION CATEGORY IN WHICH IT SCORED 64.06 PER CENT. HOWEVER, AS THE CAR DID NOT HAVE ANY ACTIVE PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION FEATURES, NO POINTS WERE GIVEN AS NO TESTS COULD BE CONDUCTED. ALSO, THE MODEL TESTED BY LATIN NCAP HAD JUST TWO FRONT AIRBAGS, AS THE BALENO SOLD IN LATIN AMERICAN MARKETS ONLY GETS TWO FRONT AIRBAGS, ABS, SEATBELT REMINDER, FRONT PRE-TENSIONERS, AND EBD AS STANDARD. HOWEVER, THE LACK OF SAFETY ASSIST SYSTEMS LIKE ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL (ESC), AUTO-EMERGENCY BRAKING, LANE ASSIST SYSTEM, SPEED ASSIST SYSTEM, FURTHER AFFECTED SUZUKI BALENO'S SCORING IN THE TEST.

THE REPORT ALSO CITED THAT IN THE FRONTAL IMPACT THE VEHICLE SHOWED STABLE STRUCTURE PERFORMANCE. WHEREAS SIDE IMPACT TEST SHOWED HIGH INTRUSION IN THE DOOR WITH POOR PROTECTION TO THE CHEST OF THE ADULT DOOR DURING THE TEST. ADDITIONALLY, THE WHIPLASH TEST SHOWED MARGINAL NECK PROTECTION. THE FOOTWELL AREA WAS RATED AS STABLE AND SO WAS THE BODYSHELL, WHICH INDICATES IT IS CAPABLE OF WITHSTANDING FURTHER LOADINGS.

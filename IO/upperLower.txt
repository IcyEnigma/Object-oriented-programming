THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION EXPANDED ITS COVID-19 BOOSTER 
RECOMMENDATIONS TO A WIDER GROUP OF PEOPLE LAST WEEK, BUT STOPPED SHORT OF 
SUGGESTING BOOSTERS FOR ALL ADULTS IN THE US.

PEOPLE WHO WERE VACCINATED WITH PFIZER'S OR MODERNA'S SHOT AT LEAST 
SIX MONTHS AGO SHOULD SEEK A BOOSTER IF THEY'RE 65 AND OLDER, LIVE OR WORK IN 
SETTINGS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF EXPOSURE TO THE VIRUS, OR HAVE UNDERLYING MEDICAL 
CONDITIONS, ACCORDING TO THE CDC. THE AGENCY ALSO RECOMMENDS BOOSTERS FOR ANY ADULT 
WHO RECEIVED JOHNSON & JOHNSON'S VACCINE AT LEAST TWO MONTHS AGO.

HEALTH EXPERTS SAY THAT LIST ISN'T AS RESTRICTIVE AS IT SOUNDS.
